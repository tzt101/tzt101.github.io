Hello, my name is Zhentao Tan. I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from 2013 to 2017, and my doctoral degree from USTC from 2017 to 2022, under the supervision of Professor Nenghai Yu. From 2022 to 2024, I conducted postdoctoral research at the Alibaba-USTC Joint Postdoctoral Research Station, under the joint guidance of Professor [Nenghai Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7620QAMAAAAJ&hl=en) of USTC, [Jieping Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T9AzhwcAAAAJ&hl=en), Vice President of Alibaba Cloud and IEEE Fellow, and [Le Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZn0f6gAAAAJ&hl=en), IEEE Fellow and member of the MICCAI Council. Currently, I work at Alibaba Cloud Apsara Lab. My research interests include large language models, multimodal models, image and video synthesis, visual image analysis, etc. I have published more than 20 related papers in top conferences and journals in computer vision, image processing, and artificial intelligence, such as CVPR, ECCV, ICLR, SIGGRAPH, EMNLP, TPAMI, and TIP.

Currently, I am dedicated to the fundamental research and practical application of large-scale models, including exploring the mechanisms and characteristics of structures such as MoE, how to train basic models to adapt to tasks in different domains, how to construct better data to drive the training of large-scale models, and how to achieve a better balance between the performance and efficiency of large-scale models. If you are also interested in large-scale model technology, please feel free to contact me, whether for collaboration or internship!
